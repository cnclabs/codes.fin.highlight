    threshold=0.5 (by default)
    1. if it's across paragraph situation (meaning predict segmentations miss the paragraph segmentation), force boundary to be 1 (need to seg)
    2. if it's across document situation (meaning predict segmentation cannot tell previous sentence is from the other document), force boundary to be 1 (need to seg)
    3. P indicate the original regular expression paragraph, G indicate the predicted segment id
