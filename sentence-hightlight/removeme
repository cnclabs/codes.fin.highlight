In October 2015, we approved plans to transform and modernize our GTI to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the GTI Restructuring ).
1001250_15_item7_p144_s1	1001250_16_item7_p57_s1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.	As part of the GTI Restructuring, we transitioned our GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used.

The implementation of the GTI Restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.
1001250_15_item7_p18_s2	1001250_16_item7_p57_s4	The net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2015 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $11 million in fiscal 2016.	The implementation of the GTI Restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.

The lower orders during the year ended June 30, 2015 created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 of approximately $178 million in net sales and approximately $127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons.

The overall decline in the skin care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in North America, Asia/Pacific and travel retail.

However, this category benefited from increased sales of certain products, particularly from La Mer and Origins.
1001250_15_item7_p52_s5	1001250_16_item7_p62_s3	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Clinique and Est e Lauder products of approximately $161 million, combined.	Net sales increases in product offerings by M A C, Smashbox, Tom Ford, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Est e Lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category.

1001250_12_item7_p153_s1	1001250_13_item7_p1_s0	The increase in cash flows from operating activities as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, favorable levels of accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and a decrease in the levels of inventory.	We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company s financial condition.
1001250_12_item7_p6_s2	1001250_13_item7_p7_s2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $31.1 million and $33.9 million as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $22.7 million and $31.1 million as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_12_item7_p11_s3	1001250_13_item7_p12_s3	We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.	As of June 30, 2013, we used an above-mean yield curve, rather than the broad-based yield curve we used before, because we believe it represents a better estimate of an effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.

If the decline in this market is more severe than we have anticipated, or other business disruptions arise, a resulting change in the key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of this trademark and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future.
1001250_11_item7_p77_s7	1001250_12_item7_p71_s7	After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, we completed an interim impairment test for goodwill and recorded an impairment charge for the remaining goodwill related to the Ojon reporting unit of $29.3 million, at the exchange rate in effect at that time.	After completing the interim impairment test on the trademark, we completed step one of the impairment test for goodwill and concluded that the fair value of the Darphin reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value including goodwill.

These actions created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 of approximately $178 million in net sales and approximately $127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons.

We recorded a devaluation charge in our fiscal 2013 third quarter, which did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net sales or operating income.
1001250_13_item7_p55_s3	1001250_14_item7_p59_s2	These challenges did not have a significant impact on our business or our consolidated financial results for the year ended June 30, 2013.

1001250_13_item7_p53_s0	1001250_14_item7_p60_s0	In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency, the bolivar fuerte.	In October 2013, the Venezuelan government introduced an auction-based foreign currency exchange mechanism ( SICAD I ).
1001250_13_item7_p53_s0	1001250_14_item7_p60_s1	In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency, the bolivar fuerte.	Participation in the weekly auctions is limited to certain industries determined by the Venezuelan government.

Participation in the weekly auctions is limited to certain industries determined by the Venezuelan government.
1001250_13_item7_p24_s3	1001250_14_item7_p60_s2	We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units.	Since we were unable to transact in the only SICAD I auction we were authorized to participate, we continued to use the official published rate of 6.3 to remeasure our VEF-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
1001250_13_item7_p173_s0	1001250_14_item7_p60_s2	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted additional changes to the country s foreign exchange controls that expanded the use of SICAD I and created a third exchange control mechanism ( SICAD II ), which allows all companies in all sectors to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose.
1001250_13_item7_p55_s1	1001250_14_item7_p61_s1	As a result, we decided to defer the previously scheduled January 2014 SMI implementation by six months.	As a result, we considered our company-specific facts and circumstances in determining the appropriate remeasurement rate, principally assessing our legal eligibility to access the available foreign exchange mechanisms, the transactions that would be eligible, our past and expected future ability to transact through those mechanisms, and our intent to utilize a particular mechanism for particular purposes.
1001250_13_item7_p73_s3	1001250_14_item7_p61_s1	As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $8.1 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark.

1001250_13_item7_p161_s6	1001250_14_item7_p61_s2	As we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets, we may decide to make discretionary cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement plan in the United States during fiscal 2014, but do not have plans to do so at this time.	Although the SICAD II mechanism and its level and frequency of exchange continue to be regulated by the Venezuelan government, it offers the possibility of foreign exchange in a theoretically open market without restricted uses and in our opinion is the only mechanism legally available at this time for our highest priority transactions, which are the import of goods.
1001250_13_item7_p0_s0	1001250_14_item7_p61_s3	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2013 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.	We have submitted applications to access U.S. dollars through the SICAD II mechanism and certain applications have been approved and we have received funds through June 30, 2014.

We have submitted applications to access U.S. dollars through the SICAD II mechanism and certain applications have been approved and we have received funds through June 30, 2014.
1001250_13_item7_p140_s1	1001250_14_item7_p61_s3	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.	We have submitted applications to access U.S. dollars through the SICAD II mechanism and certain applications have been approved and we have received funds through June 30, 2014.
1001250_13_item7_p12_s4	1001250_14_item7_p61_s3	The benefit obligation of our Domestic Plans would have been higher by approximately $34 million at June 30, 2013 had we not used the above-mean yield curve.

1001250_13_item7_p3_s0	1001250_14_item7_p176_s2	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.	Such credit-risk-related contingent features would be triggered if (a) upon a merger involving the Company, the ratings of the surviving entity were materially weaker than prior to the merger or (b) the Company s credit ratings fall below investment grade (rated below BBB-/Baa3) and the Company fails to enter into an International Swaps Derivatives Association Credit Support Annex within 30 days of being requested by the counterparty.
1001250_13_item7_p1_s0	1001250_14_item7_p176_s2	We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company s financial condition.	Such credit-risk-related contingent features would be triggered if (a) upon a merger involving the Company, the ratings of the surviving entity were materially weaker than prior to the merger or (b) the Company s credit ratings fall below investment grade (rated below BBB-/Baa3) and the Company fails to enter into an International Swaps Derivatives Association Credit Support Annex within 30 days of being requested by the counterparty.
1001250_13_item7_p23_s0	1001250_14_item7_p177_s0	Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.	The fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_13_item7_p178_s2	1001250_14_item7_p177_s0	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2013 was approximately $4.6 million.	The fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_13_item7_p27_s0	1001250_14_item7_p177_s0	To determine fair value of the reporting unit, we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.	The fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_13_item7_p73_s0	1001250_14_item7_p177_s0	The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows.	The fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_13_item7_p25_s0	1001250_14_item7_p177_s0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.	The fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_13_item7_p27_s2	1001250_14_item7_p177_s0	We believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.	The fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_14_item7_p11_s1	1001250_15_item7_p10_s0	Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels.	The amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and future compensation levels.
1001250_14_item7_p12_s1	1001250_15_item7_p11_s1	For fiscal 2014, we used discount rates for our Domestic Plans of between 4.30% and 4.90% and varying rates on our international plans of between 1.00% and 7.25%.

1001250_14_item7_p22_s0	1001250_15_item7_p11_s1	To determine the fiscal 2015 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 4.30% and 3.60% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .50% and 6.75%.	For fiscal 2015, net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our Domestic Plans of 3.60% and 4.30% and varying rates on our international plans between .50% and 6.75%.
1001250_14_item7_p19_s0	1001250_15_item7_p15_s2	The actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans exceeded expectations, primarily reflecting strong performance from global equity and U.S. fixed income investments.	The actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was lower than expected, primarily due to underperformance of U.S. plan assets partially offset by stronger than expected returns on international plan assets.
1001250_14_item7_p24_s4	1001250_15_item7_p20_s4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.	When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.

Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) decreased to 43% at June 30, 2018 from 45% at June 30, 2017, primarily due to the increase in total equity reflecting higher net earnings, partially offset by higher treasury stock purchases.
1001250_17_item7_p150_s0	1001250_18_item7_p136_s0	The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, a decrease in discretionary pension and post-retirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections.	The fiscal 2018 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2017 primarily reflected higher earnings before income taxes and an increase in accounts payable, primarily due to extended supplier payment terms.
1001250_17_item7_p150_s1	1001250_18_item7_p136_s1	These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, related to a change in legal accruals, accrued professional fees and accrued employee incentive compensation, partially offset by advertising and promotional accruals.	Also contributing to the improvement was a decrease in other assets, reflecting the collection of taxes receivable resulting from the fiscal 2017 change to the tax law in China, and an increase in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, due in part to an increase in accrued employee incentive compensation and a change in legal accruals in the prior year.

We regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies.
